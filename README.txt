INFO6044 Game Engine Frameworks & Patterns Midterm

Most of the graphics and the fly camera are from class, models used are the provided ones for the midterm and a sphere model used in class.

Built and compuled in Visual Studio 2019 Community in Debug and Release x64, Release is much faster.

CONTROLS
WASD 	- Move Camera
QE	- Raise/Lower Camera
Click and Drag Mouse	- Aim Camera	(Fly Camera from Class)
Arrow Keys	- Move Red Tank
1	- Bullet Shot
2	- Laser Shot
P	- Start AI tanks

Code associated with specific questions are filtered in Visual Studios, so the models and maze output text file are filtered under "Question 1", the base tank class and player tank class are filtered under "Question 2", and so on.  I got up to Question 5, which I kind of had to hack it for time, so it is located in main.cpp at line 705, with some additional hacks for question 4 above that (345-703).

There are modifications to InputHandling, globalThings and I think I increased the speed of the flyCamera, otherwise the non-midterm classes are stuff done in class.
